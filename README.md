# Pong-Game

I created pong game with 2 players.
One is Human which can be controlled by us. 
Another one played by Computer.
I did not use any AI algorithm but some basic math to control the moments of second player by computer itself.

It cannot make good decisions because it should calculate balls trajectory very well using AI algorithms.
I am working on the AI part to make it work.
